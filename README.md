## Dedicated repository for notes and topics regarding AWS services

In this repository, I write summaries of the services offered by AWS with the aim of creating training materials and enhancing understanding of the services. All to improve Cloud skills and achieve AWS certifications

I partitioned this repository into modules for each certification, for example:

<br>FOUNDATIONAL
<br> - Cloud Practitioner

<br>PROFESSIONAL
<br> - Solutions Architect
<br> - DevOps Engineer

<br>ASSOCIATE
<br> - SysOps Administrator
<br> - Developer
<br> - Solution Architect
<br> - Data Engineer

<br>SPECIALTY
<br> - Advanced Networking
<br> - Database
<br> - SAP on AWS
<br> - Machine Learning
<br> - Security
<br> - Data Analytics

obs: note that this list may be subject to deprecation as AWS certifications undergo regular updates and changes.
